## What's Limited Life?
### Basics
Limited Life is a hardcore-like gamemode, where you only have 24 hours to live. Every time you die, you lose 1 hour of time. Every time you kill someone, you gain 30 minutes of time. Players with more than 16 hours of time remaining will have a green coloured name, players with more than 8 hours of time remaining will have a yellow coloured name, and finally, players with less than 8 remaining will have a red coloured name. You're only allowed to kill people who have a "higher" colour than you. So green names aren't allowed to kill anyone, yellow names are only allowed to kill green names and red names are allowed to kill anyone. There's one exception to this rule; The Boogeyman!

### Boogeyman
Once every session, the Boogeyman should be rolled. When chosen as the Boogeyman, you must kill a non-red name before the end of the session. Failure to do so will result in your time to drop until it reaches the next colour. That means you could lose up to 8 hours of time if you fail! Red names can't be chosen as the boogeyman.

### Recommendations
Limited Life is intended to be played with around 14 players, on a 700x700 map.  
The server shouldn't be on 24/7. Instead, game sessions should be hosted, to make sure everyone's able to progress at the same time. I personally recommend keeping them around 3 hours long, just like in the [real series](https://youtu.be/gzaIHdjLIyM).
